  <p>It’s been the longest time of sustained disconfort I’ve ever experienced.</p>

<h3 id="stess-and-regret">Stess and regret</h3>

<p>As the title denotes, I’ve been feeling incredibly stressed lately. It’s mostly money problems, I was used to a different life standard and now it feels like every day is a struggle. I can’t sleep well at night and I’m honestly concerned I cannot sustain the life I’m having.</p>

<p>I still think changing jobs was a good idea. My overall mood has improved greatly and I feel way more motivated than before. Having a job in which no two days’ work is the same feels great.</p>

<p>Although my mood has certainly improved, there’s the trouble of bein inexperienced in a new field. The money isn’t as good as I need it to be, hours are long and the constant feeling of unstability is getting ridiculous. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling a sense of pressin anxciety that reminds me of how much I’ve lost and hard the past months have been</p>

<p>My finace has been out of the country for months now and we have no clue how to solve the issues she’s going through. Not having her in my life makes it way harder to keep a possitive outlook. I’ve started to get into a very negative mind space and that isn’t helping me at all</p>

<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h3>

<p>ONE WORD: Meditation. I can’t stress enough how much meditation has helped me. I still feel very anctious but now I know how to identify the moods changes and letting them go (or at least try to)</p>

<p>Learning something new even though I don’t feel like it. Getting to learn new technologies and skills has given me a higher sense of agency, which is something I’ve lacked in.</p>

<p>Keeping my chin up. Keeping a possitive attitude is the key to success, no matter how many times I hit the wall I must keep going. I don’t really have any choice in the matter anyways.</p>

<p>Enjoy the small things. My parents are healthy, I have a good relationship with my fiance and I have enough free time to do stuff I’m passionate about on the side. I need to keep focusing on the good things my new life has brought me</p>

<h1 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h1>

<p>Although I’ve been feeling down for a while now, I’d like to thank the people who’ve supported me this far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My wonderful fiance Nicky who has supported my desicion although that meant our level of life plummeted ever since</li>
  <li>My best friend Tony who’s been supporting me by letting me stay in his place untill I found a job and has always encouraged me</li>
  <li>The people at my company who decided to give me a chance and welcomed me with open arms</li>
  <li>The bosses and coworkers who’ve been extremely helpful and patient with me</li>
  <li>My family that has always been there</li>
  <li>My stubbornness that has been pushing me in times I was about to throw the towel, for good or for worse.</li>
</ul>
