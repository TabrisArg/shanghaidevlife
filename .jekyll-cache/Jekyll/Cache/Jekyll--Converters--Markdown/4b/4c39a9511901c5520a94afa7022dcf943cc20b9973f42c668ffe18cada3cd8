  <p>It’s been over 6 months since I quit my teaching job to become a full-time programmer. It’s been the most unconfortable time of my life. Here’s a few take aways from the whole experience so far.</p>

<h3 id="i-had-no-idea-what-i-actually-knew">I had no idea what I actually knew.</h3>

<p>I honestly Thought having done a somewhat decent job building my first web application in Angular would be enough to confortable doing software development. I was completely wrong, there a staggering ammount of basic concepts I completely skipped over and had to go back to. Learn your basics and keep relearning them, doing that would have saved me so much time.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-project-is-simple-enjoy-that-it-wont-last">If your project is simple, enjoy that, it won’t last.</h3>

<p>I started working on a small internal project, working on the front-end, just HTML, CSS and JS. It was very simple and somewhat boring untill I asked to be moved to a different project. I was moved to a client’s project and everything went to hell. The tech lead was arrogant and unhelpful, I was working on technology I had no idea how it worked, the code base was a monstosity and worst of all, I wasn’t ready at all. I wish I stayed a bit longer in the “boring” project before hitting the wall.</p>

<h3 id="know-your-niche">know your niche.</h3>

<p>I used to see myself as a jack-of-all trades, that was detrimental to my work. It took me a number of very embarrasing mistakes to figure out that you need to focus on what to do before branching out. Now I always introduce myself as a front-end developmer, I can do a number of other things in the develpment lifecycle, but now I focus on one thing at a time.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-want-to-do-different-work-do-it">Do you want to do different work? do it.</h3>

<p>Working in education gives you a very “corporate” way of thinking, where everything’s about the chain of command and people should limit their work to what they’re supposed to do. I realized IT is a more dinamic environment, therefore if you want to do something other than what you were hired for, just do it. Taking the iniciative is a very valuable skill, after doing so, I had the chance to manage teams, projects and people.</p>

<h3 id="talk-to-people-make-friends">Talk to people, make friends.</h3>

<p>Developers have a reputation for being introverted and unfriendly. This is mostly untrue, developers are usually very friendly and helpful but they actually do one thing that makes them sound unfriendly. Programmers are, for the most part, focused on efficiency and objectivity. They won’t be the kind of people to approach you first in a meeting but they will very easily be the last people to leave said meeting if you have an interesting conversation with them, and they will appreciate you for that.</p>
