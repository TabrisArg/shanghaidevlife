The massive expat exodus began last year and shows no signs of slowing down. But have you stopped to think back and reflect on all the things you'll be leaving behind?
Here're 10 things you'll definitely miss about  "Nevernight City".

##### 1. Public drinking in broad daylight
You've done it. I've done it, heck, you're probably doing it right now!
Nothing compares to the feeling of popping by FamiliMart after work and drinking a cold one to drink on the way back home

##### 2. Malls left and right
Where else are you gonna find fast food, hotpot, massage chairs and a Ferris Wheel (no, really...) in one place? not in your hometown, that's where

##### 3. The diverse work environment
It might have brought more than one argument on where to go for lunch but it was all worth the headaches. People from different countries, genders, races, religions and diets (read vegans). Wherever your next destination will be, it'll be duller, guaranteed.

##### 4. Everyone seems to be doing something interesting
Vlad is getting ready to be an extra in the next by Chinese blockbuster. Jen is working as a model on the side. Steven changed careers and now he's a programmer. Stef and Phil opened their own company.
Can your next city foster this feeling of unexpected growth? didn't think so.

 ##### 5. Taobao
Yeah, just Taobao. you know what I'm talking about.
Your drunk online shopping will never, ever be as interesting. FACT!
