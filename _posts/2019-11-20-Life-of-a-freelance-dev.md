>The life of a freelancer has some certain and obvious advantages. You get to pick what projects to work on, your schedule is flexible, you pick your own rate and you don't need to live in one place. These sound fantastic on paper, ON PAPER. Allow me to kill the buzz and present the other proverbial side of the coin.

### You get to pick what projects you work on
Only if you're already established as a freelancer and have the money to afford rejecting clients. As a beginner, most of the time you'll spend will be chasing after jobs.
I remember the first time I rejected a project, it was empowering. It was a bit less empowering when I ran out of money and had to "beg" for the client to take me back. Remember your ability to chose what to work on is directly proportional to your financial safety net.

### Your schedule is flexible 
This one is true. Do you want to start coding a storefront for a Russian client at 3 am, no pants included? you can do that!
But don't confuse "flexible" with "light". I haven't met any freelancer who isn't overworked (either by themselves or by their clients). Prepare to say goodbye to weekends, paid holidays and sick leaves. Those are a thing of the past. The only time-off you get is the time you can afford taking off.

### You pick your own rate 
Yes, but actually no. Coming from the corporate world, my salary was decided "mostly" by other people, years of experience or by the position I held. In the world of freelancing, you can decide on how much to charge but your rate's decided by the market. Do you want the client to tell you how much they can pay for your service? good luck with that. Do you think your 10+ years of experience in PHP will grant you a high rate? think again. Do you think because you work as a PM, CTO or CEO you deserve good money? I've got bad news for you.
Your rate is decided on how desirable your skills are, how good you can apply them and how big of an ROE hiring you is.

### You don't need to live in one place 
This one is also true, but not as idyllic as it looks at first sight. Not having a stable place to live in means: Your friends have an expiration date, you must always travel light, you never feel completely attached to a community and the uncertainty of not knowing where you'll be 3 months from now always rears its ugly head.
As a "digital nomad" you tend to hang out with people in the same position and guess what? those people's whereabouts are as unstable as yours. I've lost count on how many good friends I had to say goodbye too. It gets to you after a while.
I really wish I could have a car or a motorbike or an oven or a wardrove. Wherever I go, I'm at the mercy of whatever my landlord decided was "acceptable furniture". Have you ever tried moving up with your pets? It's absolute madness, I wish I had a dog. I have a large backpack and a large suitcase, sometimes I wish my life wouldn't have to fit in such a small space.
Feeling that you're part of something larger than yourself is something "non-nomads" get to experience on a daily basis. I've always felt reluctant to join a group, I feel if I get too attached it will hurt even more by the time I have to move on.
For whatever reason, it feels wrong in my head to plan anything more than a month ahead. The feeling that "I won't be there" in the future is at times hard to bear. Perhaps this is just me.

I enjoy being a freelancer, I really do. This article isn't meant to stop anybody from jumping into it. It's just a few words of caution. If you feel you can take it. For some people, including myself, the price to pay for freedom is worth it.
